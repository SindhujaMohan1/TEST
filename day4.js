for entry in education_entries:
  resume["education"].append(entry)

for entry in experience_entries:
  resume["experience"].append(entry)

for skill in skills:
  resume["skills"].append(skill)

for certification in certifications:
  resume["certifications"].append(certification)

for project in projects:
  resume["projects"].append(project)

print(resume)
In the above Python script, we use for loops to iterate over lists of education entries, experience entries, skills, certifications, and projects to construct the JSON object for the resume.

how to compare 2 json have the same properties without order
ChatGPT
To compare two JSON objects to see if they have the same properties without considering the order, you can use Python's json and collections modules. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

Parse the JSON objects.
Convert them to Python dictionaries.
Recursively compare the dictionaries.
Here's a function to compare two JSON objects for equality regardless of order:

python
Copy code
import json
from collections.abc import Mapping, Sequence

def compare_json(obj1, obj2):
    if isinstance(obj1, Mapping) and isinstance(obj2, Mapping):
        return (obj1.keys() == obj2.keys() and
                all(compare_json(obj1[key], obj2[key]) for key in obj1))
    elif isinstance(obj1, Sequence) and isinstance(obj2, Sequence) and not isinstance(obj1, str):
        return (len(obj1) == len(obj2) and
                all(any(compare_json(item1, item2) for item2 in obj2) for item1 in obj1))
    else:
        return obj1 == obj2

# Example usage
json1 = '''

# Parse JSON strings into Python dictionaries
dict1 = json.loads(json1)
dict2 = json.loads(json2)

# Compare the dictionaries
result = compare_json(dict1, dict2)
print(f"The JSON objects are {'equal' if result else 'not equal'}.")
This function, compare_json, handles both dictionary (object) and list (array) comparisons, ensuring that the properties and values are compared recursively. This approach accounts for unordered properties within objects and lists.

Print odd numbers in an array
Convert all the strings to title caps in a string array
Sum of all numbers in an array
Return all the prime numbers in an array
Return all the palindromes in an array
Return median of two sorted arrays of the same size.
Remove duplicates from an array
Rotate an array by k times

ChatGPT
Sure! Here's how you can accomplish each of these tasks using Python:

Print odd numbers in an array:
python
Copy code
def print_odd_numbers(arr):
    return [num for num in arr if num % 2 != 0]

# Example usage
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(print_odd_numbers(array))
Convert all the strings to title caps in a string array:
python
Copy code
def to_title_caps(arr):
    return [s.title() for s in arr]

# Example usage
string_array = ["hello world", "python programming", "openai gpt"]
print(to_title_caps(string_array))
Sum of all numbers in an array:
python
Copy code
def sum_of_array(arr):
    return sum(arr)

# Example usage
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sum_of_array(array))
Return all the prime numbers in an array:
python
Copy code
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def prime_numbers(arr):
    return [num for num in arr if is_prime(num)]

# Example usage
array = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(prime_numbers(array))
Return all the palindromes in an array:
python
Copy code
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def palindrome_strings(arr):
    return [s for s in arr if is_palindrome(s)]

# Example usage
string_array = ["madonna", "level", "radar", "hello", "world"]
print(palindrome_strings(string_array))
Return median of two sorted arrays of the same size:
python
Copy code
def find_median_sorted_arrays(arr1, arr2):
    merged = sorted(arr1 + arr2)
    mid = len(merged) // 2
    return (merged[mid - 1] + merged[mid]) / 2 if len(merged) % 2 == 0 else merged[mid]

# Example usage
arr1 = [1, 3, 5]
arr2 = [2, 4, 6]
print(find_median_sorted_arrays(arr1, arr2))
Remove duplicates from an array:
python
Copy code
def remove_duplicates(arr):
    return list(set(arr))

# Example usage
array = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
print(remove_duplicates(array))
Rotate an array by k times:
python
Copy code
def rotate_array(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    k = k % n  # In case k is larger than the array length
    return arr[-k:] + arr[:-k]

# Example usage
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
k = 3
print(rotate_array(array, k))
